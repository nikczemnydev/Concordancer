Java - Concordancer: This Computational Linguistics java project is a tool for creating concordances from a given corpus (such as a book). A concordance is a collection of all the instances of a word or a pattern in the corpus, along with the words (or contexts) that surround them.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR WINDOWS #
1. Download and install JDK. (link: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows)
2. Download Concordancer.java from the /src folder.
3. Download any book you like from Project Gutenberg website. TXT format recommended. (link: https://www.gutenberg.org/)
4. Rename your book file to book.txt and put it directly in your C:\\ directory. (I will eventually make version that takes the directory as command-line argument, right now it's hardcoded cause it's easier to test.)
5. Open CMD and navigate to wherever you put Concordancer.java file.
6. Compile the program using "javac Concordancer.java" command.
7. Run it using "java Concordancer" command.
